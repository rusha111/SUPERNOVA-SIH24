        <p>Bots, short for robots, are artificial accounts that relentlessly share content on social media, comment on posts, and initiate online debates on trending or overlooked topics.As the name suggests, their behavior is similar to that of automated robots. Bots are often part of a botnet—a network of bots. They are almost never singular.

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>There are good and bad bots on social platforms.</li>
            <li>Good bots automatically share the news, earthquake alerts, satellite images, or weather forecasts on social media.</li>
            <li>Bad bots, on the other hand, are designed to mimic real human activity to push an agenda or scam. Depending on its algorithm, bad bots may post content or comments on social media, follow legitimate accounts, and even send out friend requests.</li>
        </ul>

        <summary>What are trolls?</summary>
        <p>Trolls are real human beings who create social media accounts to display destructive behavior, such as making insulting comments on posts, sending multiple disrespectful DMs, etc. Trolls are often paid to harass celebrities, public figures, or media organizations. They also often engage in this behavior to satisfy a personal grudge.</p>
        <p>Spotting troll accounts goes beyond checking profile pictures, account names, bio information, or suspicious follower counts. However, you should check those just to be sure. The best way to find troll accounts is to examine the content shared by the account.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Does it link to websites that spread disinformation? One of the main signs of troll accounts is spreading disinformation.</li>
            <li>Does the user publish any personal posts at all? If they only post (or repost) third-party content, they may be a troll.
            </li>
            <li>Does the user post the exact same comment under different social posts? If they do, then you’re probably dealing with a troll.
            </li>
            <li>Does the user spend a lot of time making comments on online discussions? If yes, they probably are a troll—especially if the comments are vitriolic and negative.
